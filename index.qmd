## The "Fashion" in Economic Research {.smaller}

The world of academic research, much like fashion, has distinct trends. Methodologies and topics rise and fall in popularity over time. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides a firehose of data on these trends through its working papers.

This project was inspired by a chart in *The Economist* that visualized this very phenomenon.

::: {.column width="40%"}
**The Motivation:**

-   Can we replicate this analysis?
-   Can we build a tool to explore *any* term, not just pre-selected ones?
-   Can we automate the process so the data is always current?

## The Goal {background-color="#0B5394" .uncounted}

To build a fully automated, interactive web application that allows anyone to track and explore the evolution of research trends in NBER working papers.

## Step 1: The Automated Data Pipeline {.smaller}

The foundation of the project is an automated pipeline that runs weekly using GitHub Actions. It ensures the app's data is always up-to-date.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Part 1: Ingestion & Cleaning**
1.  A scheduled job downloads the latest metadata from the NBER website.
2.  It checks against a local SQLite database and appends only *new* papers.
3.  It cleans the data, ensuring dates are valid and text fields are standardized.

**Part 2: Processing & Preparation**
1.  A second script reads the clean data from the SQLite database.
2.  It combines titles and abstracts into a single, searchable text field.
3.  The final, enriched dataset is saved as a highly efficient Parquet file, ready for the app.

## Step 2: Exploring the Data (EDA) {.smaller}

Before building the app, we explored the data to find interesting patterns.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Top Terms (TF-IDF)**

We used TF-IDF to find the most characteristic terms for each year. This reveals the "buzzwords" of the time.

| Year | Top 5 Characteristic Terms                                  |
|:----:|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2020 | `covid`, `pandemic`, `lockdown`, `social distancing`, `stimulus` |
| 2010 | `financial crisis`, `stimulus`, `mortgage`, `banks`, `foreclosure` |
| 2000 | `technology`, `internet`, `productivity growth`, `stock returns`, `90s` |
| 1990 | `soviet union`, `trade liberalization`, `wage inequality`, `fdi`, `nafta` |

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Topic Modeling (BERTopic)**

We used BERTopic to discover latent themes in the research.

## Step 3: The Interactive App {.smaller}

The final result is a Streamlit web application that brings all this data to life.

## Uncovering New Trends

The app's real power is in custom search. For example, we can easily track the rise of research into "climate change" and "causal inference" – topics not on the original *Economist* chart.

## Conclusion & Future Work

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Conclusion**
-   It is possible to build a fully automated, publicly available tool for exploring research trends.
-   Modern text analysis techniques like TF-IDF and BERTopic can quickly surface key themes from a large corpus of documents.
-   The interactive nature of Streamlit allows for much deeper and more personalized exploration than a static chart.

**Future Work**
-   **Performance:** Implement a pre-computed inverted index for near-instant search results.
-   **New Features:**
    -   Author-level analysis.
    -   Shareable URLs to save and send specific views.
-   **Advanced Analysis:**
    -   Use word embeddings for semantic search.
